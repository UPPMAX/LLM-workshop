Which parallelization technique shards optimizer states, gradients, and/or parameters across devices to reduce memory footprint?
A) Standard data parallelism
B) Naive model parallelism
C) ZeRO (memory sharding / optimizer-state partitioning)
D) Pipeline parallelism
Correct answer: C

Moving from 32-bit floating point to 8-bit integer quantization for model weights typically results in:
A) Increased memory usage and slower inference
B) Reduced memory usage and often faster inference, with potential small accuracy loss
C) Eliminating the need for GPUs entirely
D) Always a large, unacceptable drop in model accuracy
Correct answer: B

What is a primary benefit of using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?
A) It reduces latency by avoiding document access
B) It eliminates the need for any training data
C) It grounds generation in external knowledge sources, helping reduce hallucinations and keep responses factual
D) It always increases the model’s parameter count significantly
Correct answer: C

According to the post-training section, aligning base LLMs to tasks is primarily done via:
A. Data sharding and compression
B. Supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization (reward modelling or RLHF/RLAIF)
C. Only unsupervised pre-training
D. Manual rule-based post-processing

Which pipeline stage is primarily responsible for transforming raw data into a clean, structured format suitable for modeling?
A) Ingestion
B) Feature engineering
C) Preprocessing
D) Deployment
