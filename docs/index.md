# Welcome to a NAISS LLM Workshop

## Wondering how LLMs work? 🤔  
This three‑day hands‑on workshop teaches how to run and finetune large language models (LLMs) on HPC resources. Content mixes conceptual overviews, practical demos, and runnable examples so you can build efficient inference and training pipelines on clusters.

What you'll learn

- Day 1 — Foundations: core concepts behind LLMs, running LLMs and understanding hardware that runs them.

- Day 2 — Performance & Scaling: practical techniques for speeding up and scaling models (quantization, parallelism, efficient inference) on HPC resources.

- Day 3 — Applications & Evaluation: prompt design, tooling and reasoning workflows, fine‑tuning approaches, and how to evaluate and benchmark model behavior.

The workshop will be recorded 🎥 and participants will be blurred out.
