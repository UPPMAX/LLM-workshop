    Getting an account can take a few days and if you're not accessing through
    your University (recommended) getting access to the Chalmers VPN can also
    take a few days. Start on this in time.

This LLM-Workshop is an advanced course in the sense that we expect basic
familiarity with some concepts we will be using. We will cover a very brief
refresher for the most important ones, but this will often not be sufficient to
follow along if you are completely new to the topic.

Additionally, there will be some steps to go through to get access and set up
your environment on the cluster we will be using for this workshop.
