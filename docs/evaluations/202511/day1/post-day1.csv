For future sessions, it would be very helpful to allow more time so we can fully engage with the task.    Additionally, the explanation of the exercise was quite fast and somewhat ad-hoc, making it difficult to follow what was being done and why. Since it was the only hands-on part of the day, it would have been great to receive a clearer walkthrough and enough time to actually absorb the material.    I really hope that for the next exercises we can have a more structured explanation and more time to complete the tasks. This would make the hands-on portion much more valuable and easier to grasp."

The super simple stuff in the beginning is clear but the actually useful exercises on running interference have incomplete commands in the provided material. If you’re not familiar to this environment and get a little stuck, then there is no way to catch up because the commands for the next step is no longer available since it was only shown on the screen and not included in the slides."

,,2025-11-19 14:34:22.990447+00:00,No,4,4,3,4,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,2,2,"Based on the workshop description I was expecting more hands-on sessions were the different concepts are actually practiced by the participants. In the inference session, the material about using vllm was poorly accessible and it was not clear what we were supposed to achieve. In the quantization session, I would have expected a more practical approach that shows me how I perform this and benchmark the result on my own. So far I don't think I have gained the expected practical skills for working with LLMs on the HPC system."
