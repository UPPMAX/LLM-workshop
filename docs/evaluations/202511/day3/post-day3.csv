It's overall extremely basic, but it takes some mental load to figure out exactly what the reference is to when you're new.    I really liked Jayants exercises in the way that the setups were very clear! And I feel like I will understand the html output from the slides even in a couple of months due to the structural components.     Overall I'm very happy with this workshop, thank you for organizing it!"

An idea for the next iteration might be to include recordings of the intro we had in the morning day 1 along with some exercises to complete with just “hello world” stuff to submit jobs, launch jupyter, chainlit, etc. as additional prep for new users. That way you get a little more time to digest that before diving into the LLM content.  I have decent linux experience, I’m used to working on the command line etc, but it still took me a while to orient myself in the environment, day 2 and especially today things went a lot smoother."

Sorry for that! But thanks a lot for the workshop! I think I got good overview of different LLM-related topics, and I now know what to look out for depening on my specific project needs."
