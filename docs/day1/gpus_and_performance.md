# Performance of LLM models

## Factors influencing LLM performance

- quantization
- sparsification
- kv cache
- access pattern

## Known performance boosts

- paged attention (multi-head query attention kernel)
- flash attention


## Considerations for running LLMs

### On HPC environments

### On local comnputers
