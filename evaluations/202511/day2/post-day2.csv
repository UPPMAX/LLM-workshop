,,2025-11-20 14:58:21.309358+00:00,Yes,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,Very well prepared and inclusive training!
,,2025-11-20 14:59:27.637920+00:00,Yes,3,3,2,2,3,1,2,4,5,4,4,"I feel like these surveys are too long and skipped answering yesterday due to that. I would also appreciate being able to answer that I did not participate, since I missed the datapipeline session.    I really like Jayants teaching style, the instructions for doing the exercises has been clear enough to follow. Some other exercises were more difficult to follow and assumed I would know where the files were stored etc.     Overall I'm very happy with your workshop!"

,,2025-11-20 15:21:42.944653+00:00,Yes,3,3,2,2,2,3,2,5,5,2,2,"A lot of things in this course were not so relevant to me. I am not advanced enough to do training / quantization / parallelization. Still some things in the course looks helpful towards my goal of automating the tedious work I need to do, something like:    - https://github.com/langchain-ai/deep_research_from_scratch/, so I am less limited by ChatGPT Plus plan I have to buy myself    - RAG with reasonably complicated PDF, also looking into figures/diagrams    - combining the above, so whatever ~100 papers to deep research finds about ""immune checkpoints"" it will download to my local disk, double check for relevance, and then answer my further questions using all these ~100 papers"
,,2025-11-20 15:26:55.711989+00:00,Not sure,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,3,5,5,4,"The first answer is because there was a lot of confusion with the working directory and setup. The first day participants were asked to create a directory under /mimer/.../llm-workshop and if I am not wrong also to clone the workshop repo inside the personal directory we just created. And then during the workshop we were asked to use the HOME directory. It was very confusing understanding which directory you were referring to. Maybe I missed something but since many were in the same situation I would recommend you to set a main directory with all files needed for the workshop. Then, in the main directory create a script to automate the creation and copying process of the files that should be personal to follow the course, for example mkdir /mimer/.../llm-workshop/$USER; cp /mimer/.../llm-workshop/[set_of_paths] /mimer/.../llm-workshop/$USER/[set_of_paths]; cd /mimer/.../llm-workshop/[set_of_paths] ~/protocol/jupyter/[set_of_paths] . And then telling participants to execute that script at the beginning of each day (in case people don't join all days, or even after each break asking if there is anyone who have just joined). This would make the workshop easier to follow. Apart from the confusion the workshop is very good and I would recommend it for it. Thanks"
